[MASTER]

# Add files or directories matching the regex patterns to the blacklist. The
# regex matches against base names, not paths. Blacklisted files and
# directories are exceptions to path inference and walk. They are removed BEFORE
# analysing paths recursively during discovery. Contributes to '--ignore'.
